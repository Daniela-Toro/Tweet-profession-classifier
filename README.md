# Tweet Profession Classifier ðŸ§ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

This project trains a machine learning model to **classify Spanish-language tweets** based on whether they **mention a profession or not**. It is designed for tasks such as social media content analysis, text mining, or sociolinguistic studies.

> ðŸ”§ Fully developed in **Google Colaboratory**, using Python and modern NLP libraries like Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Transformers.

## ðŸ“Š Objective

Train a Spanish BERT model to classify tweets into two categories:
- **Class 0 (NO_PROFESSION)**: Does not mention professions.
- **Class 1 (WITH_PROFESSION)**: Explicitly mentions professions.

## ðŸ§ª Best Model Metrics

| Class                 | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **NO_PROFESSION (0)** | 0.98      | 0.94   | 0.96     |
| **WITH_PROFESSION (1)** | 0.83    | 0.95   | 0.89     |

> Overall accuracy: **93.8%**  
> Average macro F1 score: **0.938**

## ðŸ§¼ Preprocessing

- Tokenization using Hugging Face's `AutoTokenizer`

## ðŸ§¾ Data Source

We used a subset of social media data, specifically from Task 1 of the shared task [**ProfNER**](https://temu.bsc.es/smm4h-spanish), focused on detecting mentions of professions in tweets published during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The original goal of the task was to analyze which professions might have been particularly vulnerable during the health crisis.

The dataset was downloaded from the [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luisgasco/profner_classification_master), and includes:

- **Training set**: with IDs, text, and labels.
- **Validation set**: same structure as training.
- **Test set**: includes only IDs and text (no labels).
